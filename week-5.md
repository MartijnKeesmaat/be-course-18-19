## Lab

 You can continue working on your prototype for the final assesment.

#### Preparation

Make sure you come to the lab prepared in advance: 

* Know which questions you want to ask.
* If you have a bug, investigate and try to make a detailed explanation of your problem.
* Ask other students if they encountered the same problem.

#### Demo

We'll do a live demo or recap a specific topic from previous lessons.

#### Feedback

During these classes we'll also be reviewing each others code. Make sure you made progress so you have something to get feedback on.
