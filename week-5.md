## Lab

 You can continue working on your prototype for the final assesment.

#### Preparation

Make sure you come to the lab prepared in advance:

* Know which questions you want to ask.
* If you have a bug, investigate and try to make a detailed explanation of your problem.
* Ask other students if they encountered the same problem.

#### Demo

We'll do a live demo or recap a specific topic from previous lessons.

#### Review

During these classes we'll also be reviewing each others code. Make sure you made progress so you have something to get feedback on.

#### Synopsis

*   **Homework**
*   **Time**: 2:00h
*   **Goals**: subgoal 11,
*   **Due**: before lab 5

#### Description

Take ± 2 hours to deploy your web app to a _hosting service_. People will actually be able to publicly access your app using an _url_ in their browser. There are [lots of different options](https://nodejs.dev/learn/where-to-host-a-nodejs-app) but we recommend using the following:
* [Glitch](https://glitch.com/): Good for demo purposes but there are some [_restrictions_](https://glitch.com/faq#restrictions).
* [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/now): By far the easiest and fastest way to deploy.
* Platform As A Service: [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs): Needs more config then Zeit but is more powerful.
* Virtual Private Server [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/): The most hardcore way to-go. They just provide an empty linux and you need to set-up on your own.

##### Preparation
* Make sure you have put your variables `.env` in `.gitignore`.
* `node_modules` should also be in there
* Update your readme with the latest changes and how-to install

##### Deploy
There are a couple of good hosting services all with different degrees of setup and customization.
