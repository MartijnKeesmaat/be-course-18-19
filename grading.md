# Grading

Participation makes up 10% of your final grade.  It’s calculated based on
whether students engage in assignments.

## Grade

| Task                               |   Weight |
| ---------------------------------- | -------: |
| [Participation][]                  |      10% |
| [Prototype][prot] (oral test)      |      90% |
| **Total**                          | **100%** |


```js
if (!participation && !prototype) {
  grade = 'GR'
} else {
  grade = (participation * 0.1) + (prototype * 0.9)
}
```
